# ROS2 Wheeled Robot Simulation

This repository documents my hands-on learning process in mobile robotics.

## Scope
- Design of a simple wheeled robot (SolidWorks)
- Importing the model into Gazebo
- ROS2-based simulation
- SLAM and autonomous navigation

## Motivation
This project is focused on building practical robotics skills for real-world applications.

## Status
Currently setting up the ROS2 and Gazebo simulation environment.
